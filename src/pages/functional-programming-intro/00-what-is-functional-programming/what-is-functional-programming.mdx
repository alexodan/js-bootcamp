First, it is a programming paradigm. What does that mean? It's basically a
mindset, a way to express and understand code. In a less abstract sense, it
focuses on programming through functions (with a few caveats that we'll discuss
in a minute!).

You might come from a different language, so the words programming paradigm
might not be new to you, after all there are many, Imperative, Procedural,
Object Oriented, Event Driven, etc, etc, etc.

Each of these paradigms require a different mindset, writing code
**imperatively** for example, means writing code as a series of instructions or
commands. Object oriented programming uses objects to send messages (through
methods) and encapsulate information (inner object state).

As we mentioned before, Functional Programming means to compose software using
functions, but also means:

- Using **pure functions**
- Avoiding **shared state**
- Avoiding **mutable data**
- Avoiding **side effects**

Sounds like a lot, so let's break it down one by one.

To use pure functions means that our functions must...

```js
// Pure function
function increment(n) {
  return n + 1
}
```

And

```js
// NOT a Pure function
let message = 'Hi'
function increment(n) {
  message = 'Bye'
  return n + 1
}
```
