First, it is a programming paradigm. What does that mean? It's basically a
mindset, a way to express and understand code. In a less abstract sense, it
focuses on programming through functions (with a few caveats that we'll discuss
in a minute!).

You might come from a different language, so the words programming paradigm
might not be new to you, after all there are many, Object Oriented, Event
Oriented, etc.

Each of these paradigms require a different mindset, writing code
**imperatively** for example, means writing code as a series of instructions or
commands. Some say that in the imperative category also falls object oriented
programming, which uses objects to send messages (through methods) and
encapsulate information (inner object state).

But functional progr...

And you might be thinking, all of those use functions! And that's true, but each
of these differ from each other

```js
function helloWorld() {
  return 'Hello World!'
}
```
