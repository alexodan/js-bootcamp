First, it is a programming paradigm. What does that mean? It's basically a
mindset, a way to express and understand code. In a less abstract sense, it
focuses on programming through functions (with a few caveats that we'll discuss
in a minute!).

You might come from a different language, so the words programming paradigm
might not be new to you, after all there are many, Imperative, Procedural,
Object Oriented, Event Driven, etc, etc, etc.

Each of these paradigms require a different mindset, writing code
**imperatively** for example, means writing code as a series of instructions or
commands. Object oriented programming uses objects to send messages (through
methods) and encapsulate information (inner object state).

As we mentioned before, Functional Programming means to compose software using
functions, but also means:

- Using **pure functions**
- Avoiding **shared state**
- Avoiding **mutable data**
- Avoiding **side effects**

Doing all this is gonna help us write code more resiliant, easier to read, less
error prone and much more predictable. Sounds like a lot, so let's break it down
one by one.

For a function to be pure, it means that given a certain input, it will always
return the same output. So for example:

```js
// This is a pure function
const increment = n => n + 1
```

And

```js
// This is NOT a pure function
let message = 'Hi'
function increment(n) {
  message = 'Bye'
  return n + 1
}
```
